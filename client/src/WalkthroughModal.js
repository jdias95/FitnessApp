                      interested in tracking your progress, then this app is
                      designed just for you. With WeGoJim, you can easily:

                      Upon registering and logging in for the first time, you'll
                      be directed to the profile page. Here, you can input your
                      information and goals to set your initial weight and
                      estimate your daily calorie expenditure/budget.

                      new weight values as frequently as you'd like. Updating
                      your weight will not only reflect changes here, but will
                      also impact your profile's estimated calorie budget and
                      expenditure.

                      The graph in this section visually represents how your
                      weight has changed over time. If you've set a target
                      weight and weekly goal in your profile, you'll also
                      receive an estimate of the time you can expect it to take
                      to reach your goal.
